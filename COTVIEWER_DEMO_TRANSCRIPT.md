# CoT Viewer Plugin - Demo Transcript

Welcome to the CoT Viewer Plugin demo. This plugin displays CoT, or Cursor on Target, messages in real-time within ATAK.

CoT is the standard messaging format used in ATAK to share location and status information between devices. When CoT events are broadcast throughout the system, this plugin captures and displays them in an organized, scrollable list.

For each CoT message, the plugin displays the event type, callsign or identifier, timestamp, and geographic coordinates including latitude, longitude, and altitude. You can access the plugin by clicking the "CoT Viewer" button in the ATAK toolbar.

Once opened, you'll see a list of all received CoT events with the most recent appearing at the top. The plugin includes a filter checkbox labeled "Only Tracked" that allows you to focus on tracked items only. Tracked items are highlighted with an orange background for easy identification.

This plugin is particularly useful for monitoring network activity, debugging CoT message flows, and understanding what location data is being shared between devices in your ATAK network. It operates passively by listening to broadcast messages, so it doesn't interfere with normal ATAK operations.

That's the CoT Viewer Plugin in sixty seconds. Thank you for watching.
